This is a compiler for a subset of the Manatee Programming Language.

When complete, students will be able to fork this repository to build compilers
and interpreters for the full language.

Manatee is described at http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/manatee.

Here are some of the full language features not implemented in this subset:

* Modules
* Codepoint escapes in character and string literals
* Object types and literals
* Streams for reading and writing
* Increment and decrement statements
* Parallel assignment
* Exceptions
* Timers
* `unless` and `until` modifiers
* Bitwise operators
* Modulo operator
* Divides operator
* Bitwise complement operator
